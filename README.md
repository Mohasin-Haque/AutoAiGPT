**Set Your Goals, AI Achieves Them.**
In everyday life, every person has to play a certain role and wants to achieve certain goals. However, often a lot of time is wasted in finalizing ideas and goals. To address this issue, we have created a GPT model called AutoAiGPT. Simply provide it with a role and associated goals, and it will create a plan to help you achieve them.
<br />
For example, if we assign the role of an entrepreneur with a goal of earning 5 crore in 5 years, AutoAiGPT will provide its thoughts based on ChatGPT, present a plan, explain the reasoning behind the plan, and provide critiques of the overall output. Even if the plan goes wrong, AutoAiGPT will correct it and adjust future plans accordingly.
